Currently you are in Loss

आसमानी अफसाने आसमान जैसी ऊंचाईयों वालों को ही मिला करते हैं 

अपने गोल्स, लव लाईफ, पैसो के लेन देन ये सब बाते किसी से शेयर ना करे

इंसान को हमेशा काम बोलना ही चाहिए 
और अपना इक्का तभी दिखना चाहिए जब सामने बाला बादशाह हो ........❤️

Give up the lay-up and go for the three-pointer
instead of taking the easy, safe shot, attempt the harder one that has a bigger reward.

When we don't know how things are working, we call it magic. Once we know how it works, we call it technique

Some goals are so worthy It's glorious even to fail ..

Tell me what is important then my work?

Don't help without ask if he is not the one who help you when you not ask

A good teacher reveal the things where it need to be.

आत्म सम्मान सब से बड़ा होता है" और कोई बात यदि हमे दुखी कर रही है तो उससे यही सोच बना लेनी चाहिए की ये गलती दोबारा नही होनी चाहिए

Accept it what happen to you

Never talk to G 

"Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." — Alan Turing

Power

Relation depends up interest

Apni personal life public karke apna mazak udwa liya ...

Choose your life partner wisely 
Your looks matter more than you or society admits
Network with people : Your social network is actually your net worth
Your Education Qualification Matters (IIT Tag & for network & how you communicate & How you dress)
Change Friends
Give time to parents
Friendships also have an expiry date
Society is hierarchical (Where you are, what you do? then you get respect)

If(Give Up == GATE_CSE){
	Accept("9-5 Job + Home Work + 20k Salary + Maruti Suzuki after 10 years of had works");
}else{
	Gain("IIT Tag + Networking + 40-50LPA + Product Based Company(Google, Amazon, Microsoft) + International Trip
		+ Higher Saving + Ahead from you Batch Mates + YOur One Month Salary can fullfill the dreams of 10yrs of other");
}

You woke up only when you realized that your batchmates, just because they got admission into a B.Tech program, are preparing for placements for a small opportunity and a relatively low salary. Now you have understood that this will not lead to anything significant, so you are preparing for GATE instead.

This time never comes back, Just one last time Saksham

Very important hidden factor (people ignore this)
Coding-only path:

Burnout

Job insecurity

Constant “new tech” pressure

GATE + IIT path:

Brand value for life

Easier foreign MS/PhD options

Teaching, research, system roles, leadership

One blunt truth (no filter)

Yes ❌
Some batchmates may earn earlier than you (first 2–3 years).

But later ✔️
You will overtake most of them, and stay ahead.

Your batchmates look ahead now.
You are building depth.

Depth pays later, but it pays much bigger.

You’re not late.
You’re just on a harder, smarter road.
