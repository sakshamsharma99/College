Ask yourself these five critical questions before finalizing a project:

1. What problem am I solving?
2. Who is this product for and how will it be used?
3. What are the constraints I may encounter during development? These could be in terms of time and complexity.
4. Where it will be deployed, how load balancing, fine tuning, data analysis etc will be done.
4. What are the measurable success criteria.
